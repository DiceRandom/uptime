## Install

Drag and drop [uptime.exe](https://github.com/DiceRandom/uptime/releases), to your System32 folder found at `C:\Windows\System32\`


> note, yes i know this very f#cking suspicious, if you want to build it be my guest. If you don't wanna place the exe to your S32 folder. Direct your system path to a folder with the exe.

## Todo

```
C:\Users\Dice> uptime
  Your PC has been on for 26:53:11
  Thats more than a whole day!
```
